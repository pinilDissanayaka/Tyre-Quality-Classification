# Tyre-Quality-Classification

## Objective:
Developing an automated system for the detection of defective tyres using a dataset comprising 1854 digital tyre images categorized into two classes: defective and good condition. This project aims to leverage machine learning and computer vision techniques to enhance quality control processes in the tyre industry, ultimately reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by faulty tyres.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of digital images of individual tyres, each labeled as either defective or in good condition. This collection provides a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and professionals in transportation, automotive industries, and quality control.
